# confluence-js-iframes
A repo for JS snippets that used to be on Softwire confluence now that we've moved away from on premise confluence and the html plugin has been discontinued.

They live in the /docs folder, because I couldn't get github pages to read from, say, /public

If they're useful for anyone else, feel free to use!
